        Shah Jahan had four sons — Dara Shukoh, Shuja, Aurangzib, and Murad Bakhsh —
        each governing a province. When the emperor fell gravely ill in September 1657,
        all four raised armies and marched for the throne.
    - label: false
      text: >
        Aurangzib, the ablest general, allied with Murad Bakhsh and drove north from the
        Deccan. He shattered Dara's advance guard at Dharmat near Ujjain (April 1658) and routed Dara
        himself at Samugarh. Agra fell; Shah Jahan was imprisoned in the Fort; Aurangzib
        crowned himself at Delhi in July 1658.
    - label: false
      text: >
        Shuja proclaimed himself emperor in Bengal and pushed west twice, but was beaten
        back at Bahadurpur and Khajwa. After the second defeat he fell back to Dacca,
        then fled east to Arakan, where he was never heard from again.

      text: >
        Dara fled for nearly two years — north to Punjab, then south through Sindh and
        Gujarat — before being betrayed near the Bolan Pass by a Baloch chief. Brought
        to Delhi in chains, he was executed in August 1660.
    - label: false
      text: >
        Murad Bakhsh, having served as Aurangzib's instrument, was quietly imprisoned
        and executed in 1661. Aurangzib — now Alamgir, Conqueror of the World —
        reigned alone for 49 years.
