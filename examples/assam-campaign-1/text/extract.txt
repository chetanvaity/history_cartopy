**7 MUGHAL RELATIONS WITH KOCH BIHAR AND ASSAM BEFORE 1658**

**7.1** Early in the sixteenth century, a Mongoloid soldier of fortune named Viswa Singh (ruled 1515-40) founded a dynasty which still rules over Koch Bihar. He adopted the Hindu religion and Hindu culture and also organized his administration and army. His eldest son and successor Nara Narayan (ruled 1540-84) was a saintly but reckless ruler. Raghudev, the son of his younger brother, forced to contest the throne with him as king over Kamrup on the east, where the Muslim historians call the province Sankosh and bar which now forms the Goalpara and adjacent districts of Western Assam. Raghudev's son Parikshit attacked Lakshmi Narayan, the successor of Nara Narayan, who sought the aid of the Mughal governor of Bengal. The Muslim army frontier was carried and annexed Koch Hajo (1612), and thus the imperial frontier was carried up to the river Nadi on the north-east, and the Mughal Government came into contact with the Ahom kings, who ruled over central and eastern Assam across the Bharali river.

The Ahoms were a branch of the Shan race, whose cradle was the hilly region lying north of their ancient kingdom of Upper Burma. In the thirteenth century a prince of the Shan race established himself in the south-east corner of the Brahmaputra valley. He then advanced westwards, conquering the tribes on the way. The Ahoms were a hardy race of demon-worshippers, eating beef and fowl and drinking spirituous liquor, with the Burmese expertise in building stockades and bamboo bridges, plying boats and night attacks. They were Feudally organized under a number of noblemen (called Gohains, Baruas, and
Phukans). The nobles cultivated their estates by semi-servile service. Their army consisted chiefly made of foot-soldiers, armed with bows, swords, and spears, and supplemented by elephants. The king was the patriarch of the clan, and was venerated as a semi-divine being, and the succession was generally good or else the tribe (Sondra) abasing punished the evil despot drastically, men being put to death with torture or banishment.

But in the course of their stay in Assam, the Ahoms began to change under the influence of Indian civilization and the Hindu religion. Hindu Brahmans had entered Assam in the time of the queens of the Bengal and Koch race. Ahoms learning became use of fire-arms, and the influence of the superior religious preached by Shankaradeva and other saints, and the Vaishnavas (or Gosains) in the settlement of large numbers of Bengal (preached by Mahapurushas) and other saints, and made great progress in the Ahom kingdom.

The weak point of the Ahoms was diversity of population. The dominant race of the Ahoms, the middle stratum of population, was composed of the Assamese proper-plainsmen with many Bengal accretions, defective of physical strength, endurance and martial spirit. At the bottom of society lay a vast body of slaves, some being Mongoloid serfs, but in most cases hand prisoners of war. These last were unwilling dwellers in the land.

Early in the seventeenth century the Mughals, after annexing Koch Hajo (1612), had a long war with the Ahoms, who had harboured a prince of the deposed dynasty. At last in 1638 a peace was made, by which the Muhammadans were allowed to retain the country west of the Bar Nadi in the north Brahmaputra valley-the centre of the Asurar Ali in the region south of that great river. This peace lasted for 20 years.

**7.2 AHOM CONQUEST OF KAMRUP 1658**

When in 1657 Shuja, Prince of war with the troops of Bengal to contest his father's throne, Pran Narayan, the Rajah of Koch Bihar, took advantage of the defenceless state of the province, and sent an army under his wazir Bhaiknath to arrest an obnoxious vassal who had fled to Mughal territory (Hajo). To arrest an Ahom vassal who had fled to Mughal territory. Mir Lutfullah Shirazi, making preparations for entering Mughal Kamrup. Mir Lutfullah Shirazi,
the faujdar of Gauhati, to attack from two sides and knowing the jaydan from Bengal to be impossible, fled to Dacca. The Assamese occupied Kamrup without a blow, and plundered the region as far as Dacca. The Assamese occupied it and ravaged and held it for months, through they found it impossible thing to keep it. But by June 1660 the civil war was finally over and Mir Jumla was appointed viceroy of Bengal with orders to punish the lawless peoples of the province, especially those of Assam and Magh (Arakan).

**7.3 MIR JUMLA CONQUERS KOCH BIHAR AND ASSAM**

On 4 November 1661, the viceroy started from Dacca with an army of 12,000 cavalry of all races, 30,000 foot-soldiers, a war-fleet of 323 large vessels of all sizes and a great train of artillery, he was accompanied by 1,000 cannons of musketters (and a crew of long war-boats being covered all over called kosha) and made his way through the difficult country. After passing 14 passes, each of most powerful of them Mir Jumla in six days reached the capital (9 December), the highway. In six days Mir Jumla reached the capital (9 December), which had been deserted by the Rajah and his people (qazi) neglected demolishing the principal mosques and the bazaars, whose temple was built by the Hinduism was changed to Alamgirnagar, the whole kingdom was annexed to the Mughal Empire.

After a 16 days' stay at the general left Koch Bihar (4 January 1662), and invaded Assam. On account of the jungles and numerous nulas the daily progress did not exceed five to eight (or 5 miles). His men had to go through impenetrable thickets, wading streams devastated by or being rotted with heavy slaughter. The Ahom army, before retreated the Brahmapturas, carrying all the stockades and trenches full of bamboo spikes on the way. Fort after fort was occupied-Jogighopa at the mouth of the Mona river (20 January), Gauhati, Kajali at the mouth of the Kalang, Samdhara at the mouth of the Bar Nadi (5 February), Panidu, Belida, Kajali at Simlagarh on opposite to it on the south bank of the Brahmaputra (25 February).

The Ahom fleet in its south bank of the Brahmaputra (25 February), opposite Kaliang to it on the south bank, when Mir Jumla annihilated the enemy's naval power seized 300 boats.

the invaders reached Garhgaon on 17 March. In Kajali Jayadvaja had fled seven days ago, abandoning his capital and all his treasures. The spoils taken in all amounted to-82 elephants, 3 lakhs of rupees in cash, 675 pieces of artillery, 1,000 maunds of gold and silver vessels, 8,000 maunds of grain, 173 stores, and 1,000 boats.

Mir Jumla made his arrangements for going into the cantonment and kept a body of the conquered country for the coming rainy season. Shaista Khan was sent up the river to capture the Ahom heir-apparent, but had to stay in that town. The general (18 miles further up to the north), but had to fall back for want of supplies. Another column at Mathurapur, 28 km (17 miles) above Garhgaon, in the country of the Abor Nagas. The Ahom capital, containing all the authority of Garhgaon. Mir Murtaza was Mughal army, was held by an adequate garrison, the forces of the Ahom were distributed, the Bar nobles with their along with Dihing in the south of Garhgaon. Most of the Bar nobles with their wealth fled to Namrup, the Rajah to Namrup, the Brahmaputras and province of the Dihing dominant.

**7.4 CONSTANT FIGHTING WITH AHOMS**

There was, however, no repose in the Mughal outposts even from the in May, the outposts. Even Garhgaon was assaulted, but the attempt might fail. Early the movements of troops became impossible, and from the beginning were isolated. In fact, during the whole season, the seven imperial outposts of October, many Ahom and Naga raids could come from the Lakhau because it was a state of siege. Each of its posts stood like a hard surrounded by in May to near the end of October, many Ahom and Assam lived water, and no provision could come from outside attacked Assam lived the river Garhgaon was not deep enough for the large armed boats, while the small trading vessels could not safely ply on it so long as the Ahom entrenchments on its banks were not won over.

For lack of proper food, cavalry horses and draught cattle perished by the thousand. No supplies of any kind, not even news, could come from the outside world.

When the Mughal outpost at Gajpur fell, the Ahoms, thus cutting off communications between the Mughal army and navy. At Garhgaon, too, Mir Jumla, therefore, contracted and kept the garrison in perpetual alarm. Mir Jumla, therefore, concentrated all his country east of Lakhau. Mathurapur and The Ahoms held: The Ahom king Garhgaon recovered his country.

The vigour of Ahom attack was now redoubled. The minor encounters that took place almost daily are beyond count. The well-bred cannoniers of Delhi fought in water bespattered with mud-but ever vigilant and ever ready to fight the enemy.

After almost the rainy season, an assault force was delivered on Garhgaon on the night side of 8 July. The Ahoms broke down the bamboo entrenchment, posted there and seized the palace half enclosure, routed the Buxua, match-lock-men and entered of the enclosure of the garrison. captured of Garhgaon. Finally, by exertion of every man in the garrison, the citadel was recovered, and delivered on 12 nulas crossed the river, all the granaries of all the assaults, was delivered on 12 July by the entire Ahom army in four divisions from four sides at the same time, but all failed, and never again was the enclosure penetrated by the Mughals.

In August and a terrible epidemic broke out in the Mughal camp at Mathurapur fever and flux carried of hundreds daily. Dilir Khan's corps was reduced from 1,500 horsemen to about 450; of its whole strength. At Garhgaon, too, only 3,000 men could mount guard of about 450 of the whole corps available for service. There was rice no in course rice in camp at a gold mohur a price. A pipe of tobacco sold at Rs 5 or 6; tobacco opium at a gold mohur, a seer of tobacco sold at Rs 10 and salt, tobacco opium at a gold mohur, The Hindustanis and Turk soldiers languished for the same rate as she last. the horses perished from eating rice.

At late in Mathurapur became unbearable and on 17 August the army transport, many of the sick were left behind for want army retreated to Garhgaon; many of the sick were left behind for want of transport.

The cautious Ahoms renewed their siege of Garhgaon and there was fighting every night outside the fort. The pestilence now reached its
extreme, as the refugees from Mathurapur had infected the garrison of Garhgaon. In the third week of September, the waters went down and Mir Jumla moved down the river, while the water soldiers by boat rejoined the main army.

**7.5 MIR JUMLA RESUMES THE OFFENSIVE**

Through the Ahom king now felt himself safe, Mir Jumla again passed over the Dihing with his army. His Gauhati and boats plied with Dacca and through repeated attacks he landed with some surprise against the Ahom nobles and making the co-operated from Majuli island. And finally, when the the Ahoms began to from Lakhau large quantities of provisions were now sent with Dacca and through repeated attacks he landed and made reprisals against and cut off from Lakhau land. And finally, when the Ahom king, alarmed and arrived at Garhgaon, on 24 and 31 October (and having dried up, now took the place of famine.

And Jayadvaja, the Mughal cavalry was irresistible. Mir Jumla and his nobles fled to the hills, and reached to the farthest shrine to Tipam (18 November). This was destined to be the farthest Mir Jumla resumed the offensive, and reached to the farthest point to Namrup at Tipam. On 20 November, This was destined to be the farthest point of his advance. On 20 November he had a famine. But the damp climate was at the beginning of the disease. On 30 November Badar, the Emperor's to Mughal, side, and was highly rewarded and made the Emperor's victory for desertion, and Jayadvaja was left helpless and alone in the sample of Eastern Assam. More Ahom nobles followed his palpable pestiferous hills of Namrup.

On 10 December, Mir Jumla had a severe attack of illness: a burning fever seized him, to which pleurisy was soon added. The entire Mughal army refused to enter their pestilential and unexplored hills of Namrup and plotted to desert their general and return home.

**7.6 TREATY OF PEACE WITH ASSAM**

Through Dilir Khan's mediation a treaty was signed with the Ahom king, on the following terms:

(i) Jayadvaj would send his daughter and the sons of the Tipam Rajah to the Mughal Court.

(ii) The Ahom would deliver immediately a war indemnity as under:
  - 20,000 tolas of gold, 1,20,000 tolas of silver, and 20 elephants to the Emperor (besides 90 elephants and 5 lakhs of silver for Mir Jumla and Dilir Khan respectively).

(iii) During the next 12 months he would deliver 3 lakhs of tolas of silver and 90 elephants in three equal instalments, as the balance of the indemnity.

(iv) Thereafter he would pay an annual tribute of 20 elephants.

(v) Pending the full payment of the indemnity, the sons and the Bura Gohain, Parbat Gohain, the Garhgaon Phukan, and the Bargohain, were to be held by the Nawab as hostages.

(vi) The western limit of the Ahom kingdom should be the Bharali Assam was annexed to the empire of Durranga. Thus the south bank, and river on the north bank, to the province of the Kalang river on the south bank. Thus more than half of the Ahoms from the rich Mughal dominions, was to be debarred from the Ahom to become a semiCapitals were to be released to Baikhi Kamrup) were to be released to the elephants. (especially of Baduli Kamrup) were to be released to the Ahoms, as also the wife and children of Baduli Kamrup, who had thrown in prison.

On 5 January 1663, when the Ahom king's daughter, hostages, and some camp, and five days later Mir Jumla began his return march. At last, nobles had come to the Mughal camp, and the Mughals return march. At last, yielding to medical advice he embarked on a boat and glided down the river; but he died on the way on 31 March 1663.

**7.7 GREATNESS OF MIR JUMLA'S CHARACTER**

Judged as a military exploit, Mir Jumla's conquest of Assam was a success. He forced the Rajah to make a humiliating treaty of submission to a large indemnity and tribute. If its political consequences are to a large territory and further permanent, it is because of a of territory, and so far as that grasped large annexation were extended further and even Gauhati was won.

Though only four years here, his expedition ended in a heavy loss of men, his own death from disease and exhaustion, and the speedy loss of his acquisitions in Koch Bihar, yet his character shone with supreme radiance in this enterprise. "And justly, yet his character shone with supreme radiance so much humanity and justice, or kept his soldiers, princes and captains

in the escape from Agra to Gwalior. Soon after his arrival, the Ahom monarch, Ram Singh laid siege to Gauhati, but all his attempts at a storm failed. In March 1671 he fell back on Rangamati and stayed there for some years, doing nothing. Finally in 1676 he permitted to return to Agra.

After the death of Chakradvaja (1670), the Ahom monarchy became greatly weakened by internal troubles, no less than unscrupulous kings, whom of them succeeded each other for selfish gain, made and unmade the supreme power. In February 1679, the Bar Phukan escaped Garhgaon into the hands of the Mughals.

Between 1679 and 1681 Gadhahar Singh seized the Ahom throne and restored the glory of his house. He easily captured Gauhati with a small amount of his army. Talikota, Mahamaya was finally lost to the Mughals.

While Mir Jumla, farangi was in Garhgaon (1662). Koch Bihar had been recovered, Shasta Khan and the Mughal governor of Bengal expelled. In March 1664, and Mughal and the Mughal armies, reached Rajmahal in fear of the Mughals. This Rajah, Pran Narayan by his submission, reached Rajmahal and made his submission. This Rajah, Pran Narayan died in 1665, and thereafter, for nearly half a century, was paralyzed by twins, royal oppression and internal disorder. The Mughals took advantage of this extent of their sway over the western and eastern portions of the kingdom, conquering much of the present districts of Rangpur and Cooch west Kamrup, and forcing the Rajah in 1711 to confirm these gains by treaty.
